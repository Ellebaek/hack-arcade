Hacked at medi-data hackathon Wednesday 27 March 2019. Simple android app to capture a picture (selfie) and evaluate the mood/emotions by consuming the Amazon Rekognition Service.

Before building you need to add a default face image to res/drawable (app/src/main/res/drawable) named download.jpg
Before testing the Amazon Rekognition Service, you need an account and you need to supply your credentials in the class AWSCredentialProvider.java
